# Validation — NUCLEO-G071RB

**Tier: L1 smoke (SIM-DERIVED).** This board was onboarded 2026-09-19 with no
STM32G0 silicon on the bench: every register number traces to RM0444 / DS12232
/ ST's CMSIS `stm32g071xx.h`, and the evidence below is simulator-side only.
Do not read this page as a hardware-validation claim.

## 0. Artifact identity

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Fixture | `tests/fixtures/nucleo-g071rb-smoke.elf` |
| sha256 | `8870863f4721487f7e8eb26751b16cdccb9cf20976613dae056b2759ee1093c4` |
| Built from | `crates/firmware-stm32g0-demo` (thumbv6m-none-eabi, release) |
| Chip config | `configs/chips/stm32g071.yaml` |
| System config | `configs/systems/nucleo-g071rb.yaml` |

## 1. Build the firmware

```bash
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/home/andrii/src/labwired/core/target
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4
cargo build -p firmware-stm32g0-demo --release --target thumbv6m-none-eabi -j 4
```

Observed: `Finished release profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.45s`.

## 2. RCC model unit tests (G0 layout)

The G0 register map is its own `stm32g0` layout in
`crates/core/src/peripherals/rcc.rs`; these tests pin offsets and behaviour.

```bash
cargo test -p labwired-core --lib "peripherals::rcc::tests::test_rcc_g0" -j 4 -- --nocapture
```

```
test peripherals::rcc::tests::test_rcc_g0_hsi_ready_bit_positions ... ok
test peripherals::rcc::tests::test_rcc_g0_layout_and_clock_switch ... ok
test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 3541 filtered out; finished in 0.01s
```

This pins CR reset `0x0000_0500` (HSION bit8 | HSIRDY bit10), the 3-bit
CFGR.SW/SWS switch (HSISYS/HSE/PLLRCLK gated on CR ready, LSI/LSE on
CSR/BDCR ready), IOPENR@0x34, AHBENR@0x38, APBENR1@0x3C (USART2EN bit17),
APBENR2@0x40 (USART1EN bit14), and the resolver names the chip yaml uses.

## 3. Smoke survival gate

```bash
cargo test -p labwired-core --test firmware_survival test_nucleo_g071rb_smoke_survival -j 4 -- --nocapture
```

```
test test_nucleo_g071rb_smoke_survival ... ok
test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 73 filtered out; finished in 11.08s
```

(Final run — re-run against the committed fixture `sha256 8870863f…` after the
last source-formatting rebuild, on a freshly compiled `labwired-core`.)

The case loads the committed ELF, runs it for 800 000 cycles, asserts the PC
stays in flash/RAM, and requires `OK` in the UART capture. A wrong G0 RCC
offset (IOPENR/APBENR1) leaves USART2 clock-gated and the assertion fails —
so this is a real gate on the G0 register map, not just a boot check.

## 4. Config-build gate

```bash
cargo test -p labwired-core --test stm32g071_config -j 4 -- --nocapture
```

```
test stm32g071_from_config_builds ... ok
test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

Asserts the system manifest builds, `rcc`/`gpioa`/`gpioc`/`usart2`/`usart1`/
`systick` are on the bus, flash = 128 KB @ `0x08000000`, SRAM = 36 KB @
`0x20000000`, `cpu_hz = 64 MHz`. `SystemBus::from_config` errors on any
unresolved `clock:` gate, so this also pins that every gate in the yaml
resolves through the `stm32g0` layout.

## 5. Config vs vendor SVD

The ST CMSIS-SVD is vendored at `tests/fixtures/real_world/stm32g071.svd` and
wired into `crates/core/tests/svd_conformance.rs`, which checks every declared
peripheral base and IRQ against the SVD (deviations must be allow-listed).

```bash
cargo test -p labwired-core --test svd_conformance -j 4 -- --nocapture
```

```
test every_vendored_svd_is_used_by_the_gate ... ok
test chip_configs_match_their_svd ... ok
test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 2.54s
```

## 6. Bus-proof matrix + catalog

```bash
cargo test -p labwired-core --lib bus_proof_matrix -j 4 -- --nocapture
cargo test -p labwired-core --test session_catalog -j 4 -- --nocapture
```

```
test tests::bus_proof_matrix::bus_proof_matrix_is_complete_and_not_fabricated ... ok
test tests::bus_proof_matrix::bus_proof_matrix_never_regresses ... ok
(test result: ok. 10 passed; 0 failed; ...)

test every_catalog_chip_builds_or_is_listed_in_needs ... ok
(test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; ...)
```

`session_catalog` now enumerates 39 chips (38 → 39 with stm32g071).

## 7. CLI run — UART evidence

```bash
cargo run -q -p labwired-cli -- \
  --firmware tests/fixtures/nucleo-g071rb-smoke.elf \
  --system configs/systems/nucleo-g071rb.yaml \
  --max-steps 200000
```

Observed stdout:

```
OK
```

and the trailing report (stderr) records `Final PC: 0x80002ca`, 200000
instructions / 239982 cycles, exit code 0. This is the L1 success criterion:
reset vector sane, USART2 TDR bytes leave the part, no critical unmapped
access on the smoke path.

Both example scripts also pass when driven through the CLI test runner:

```bash
# firmware must exist at the path the yaml declares
mkdir -p target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release
cp "$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/firmware-stm32g0-demo" \
   target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/
cargo run -q -p labwired-cli -- test --script examples/nucleo-g071rb/io-smoke.yaml \
  --output-dir out/nucleo-g071rb/io-smoke --no-uart-stdout
cargo run -q -p labwired-cli -- test --script examples/nucleo-g071rb/uart-smoke.yaml \
  --output-dir out/nucleo-g071rb/uart-smoke --no-uart-stdout
```

```
PASS  2/2 checks · io-smoke · 200000 steps · 0.55s
PASS  2/2 checks · uart-smoke · 200000 steps · 0.52s
```

## 8. Register-vs-SVD coverage (ratchet baseline regenerated)

```bash
UPDATE_COVERAGE_BASELINE=1 cargo test -p labwired-core --test register_coverage -j 4 -- --nocapture
```

Measured for `stm32g071`: **653 SVD registers, 571 mapped, 500 reset-matched,
343 modeled (52.5%)**. The conservative `modeled` count requires a register to
store state or reproduce its non-zero reset; write-only and read-only-reset-0
registers are under-counted by construction. Recorded in
`docs/coverage/register-modeling.json` (ratchet: may not regress).

Related regenerations in the same session:
- `docs/coverage/chip-conformance.{json,md}` — stm32g071 **L1**, estate ✓,
  40 peripherals, behavior gate `test_nucleo_g071rb_smoke_survival`.
- `docs/coverage/bus-visibility.{json,md}` — stm32g071 **✓ UART ✓ SPI ✓ I2C**
  (the family-reused SPI/I2C models on the G0 bases drive decodable edges;
  that is shallow evidence — see the matrix gaps).

## 9. Unsupported-instruction audit

```bash
./scripts/unsupported_instruction_audit.sh \
  --firmware tests/fixtures/nucleo-g071rb-smoke.elf \
  --system configs/systems/nucleo-g071rb.yaml \
  --max-steps 200000 \
  --out-dir out/unsupported-audit/nucleo-g071rb
```

Result (script exit 0):

```
Audit summary:
  unknown_thumb16: 0
  unhandled_thumb32: 0
  unknown_riscv: 0
  unsupported_total: 0
  report: .../out/unsupported-audit/nucleo-g071rb/report.md
AUDIT_EXIT=0
```

`report.md` records 200000 instructions executed, 0 unsupported observations,
**100% instruction support coverage** on the smoke path.

## 10. Tier-1 peripheral fixture (peripheral depth)

`examples/tier1-fixture/stm32g071/` (standalone crate, `thumbv6m-none-eabi`)
raw-register self-tests each peripheral class and reports the TIER1 protocol
over USART2. Committed blob: `tests/fixtures/tier1/stm32g071.elf`.

Build:

```bash
cd examples/tier1-fixture/stm32g071
cargo build --release --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
cp target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/tier1-fixture-stm32g071 \
   ../../../tests/fixtures/tier1/stm32g071.elf
```

Run (from the repo root; the matrix runner uses the same command shape):

```bash
labwired run --chip configs/chips/stm32g071.yaml \
  --firmware tests/fixtures/tier1/stm32g071.elf --max-steps 8000000 \
  2>&1 | grep -a TIER1
```

Observed (verbatim):

```
TIER1 clock PASS
TIER1 gpio PASS
TIER1 timer PASS
TIER1 pwm PASS
TIER1 dma PASS
TIER1 irq PASS
TIER1 i2c PASS
TIER1 spi PASS
TIER1 adc PASS
TIER1 wdt PASS
TIER1 rtc PASS
TIER1 done
```

Per-class notes:

- Each gated class is poked **while its RCC bit is off** and must read dead
  (0), then enabled — a wrong G0 gate offset fails the class, not just the
  value check.
- `clock` uses GPIOC (IOPENR bit2) for its gate proof; `gpio` uses GPIOA;
  `timer` TIM2/APBENR1 bit0; `pwm` TIM1/APBENR2 bit11; `dma` AHBENR bit0;
  `i2c` APBENR1 bit21; `spi` APBENR2 bit12; `adc` APBENR2 bit20; `rtc`
  APBENR1 bit10. `irq` software-pends NVIC IRQ 30 and requires the handler
  to run; `wdt` is ungated (LSI on silicon).
- `pwm` prints `PASS` (TIM1 advanced compare latching is genuinely
  exercised), but its **matrix cell renders `na`**: the class heuristic in
  `crates/cli/src/tier1.rs` keys on an `_pwm` peripheral-id suffix and the
  chip yaml declares TIM1 as `tim1`. Renaming the yaml id to `tim1_pwm`
  (the G4/H5/WB convention) would record the cell; that rename is left as a
  follow-up because the id is a public descriptor.
- The fixture's terminal loop keeps printing nothing; the `run` driver exits
  on the idle loop, and the deterministic `test` driver runs to
  `max_steps`. The full transcript through `TIER1 done` is complete at
  <=13k steps (measured by bisecting `limits.max_steps` with a
  `uart_contains: "TIER1 done"` script).

## What is actually modelled vs stubbed

| Block | State |
|-------|-------|
| Cortex-M0+ core + decoder | Modelled (full Thumb-2 decode; ARMv6-M subset not enforced — build target does that) |
| Flash 128 KB / SRAM 36 KB windows | Modelled |
| SysTick, NVIC | Modelled |
| RCC `stm32g0` layout | Modelled to the register/behaviour level above; **PLL frequency not modelled** |
| GPIO A–D, F (stm32v2 layout) | Modelled; LD4 (PA5) and B1 (PC13) declared in `board_io` |
| USART2 (and USART1/3/4, LPUART1) | Modelled on the `stm32v2` USART layout; only USART2 exercised end-to-end |
| Timers TIM1/2/3/6/7/14/15/16/17, LPTIM1/2 | Declared with real bases/IRQs; family timer model, not G0-diffed. Tier-1 exercises TIM2 32-bit counting and TIM1 advanced compare latching |
| DMA1, CRC, RTC, IWDG, WWDG, EXTI, SYSCFG, PWR, FLASH | Declared; family models. Tier-1 exercises DMA1 mem-to-mem + TCIF1, RTC WPR/TR and IWDG write-protection |
| I2C1/2, SPI1/2 | Declared; L4/classic controller models. Tier-1 exercises I2C1 PE/BUSY/absent-slave NACK and SPI1 TXE/BSY/RXNE |
| ADC1 | L4 ADC model: real conversion by value from a fixed internal source, scaling with `CFGR.RES` (Tier-1). No external analog input, not G0-diffed |
| DAC1 | Register window only; analog output not modelled |
| DBGMCU | APB @ `0x40015800`; idcode `0x460` is ST's published DEV_ID, **not bench-read** |
| UCPD, CEC, VREFBUF, COMP, DMAMUX | Not declared / not modelled |

## Known fidelity limits (honest)

1. **No silicon validation.** No NUCLEO-G071RB has been connected. Everything
   is document-derived; the SVD/header checks catch wrong addresses, not wrong
   behaviour.
2. **No executing-fidelity differential** (no walk-vs-scheduler oracle) and no
   `walk_deleted` claim for this board.
3. The **engine does not enforce ARMv6-M**; the `thumbv6m-none-eabi` toolchain
   is the only ISA guardrail.
4. **Baud/timing are functional, not cycle-accurate.** The smoke's BRR value is
   computed for 16 MHz HSISYS but is not used for wire timing in a way that
   has been validated against a scope.
5. **Interrupts are only partially exercised.** The smoke is a polled
   bring-up; the tier-1 fixture proves NVIC *software-pend delivery* for one
   vector (IRQ 30), but no claim is made that any peripheral's own IRQ line
   reaches the NVIC on this part.
6. **SPI/I2C are controller-level only**: bus-visibility proves decodable
   edges on the controller's own lines; tier-1 adds register-level
   round-trips and an absent-slave NACK, but no external device round-trip.
7. `dbgmcu.idcode` (`0x460`) and the PLL frequency are documented constants,
   not measured values.

## Follow-ups

- Bench a NUCLEO-G071RB over SWD and capture DBGMCU_IDCODE + reset values
  (this would promote the board to `silicon-smoke` and let `reset_oracle` be
  set in `chip_conformance.rs`).
- Add a walk-vs-scheduler differential if the G0 is ever made walk-deleted.
- Extend `svd_conformance` alias mapping to cover `dbgmcu` ↔ SVD `DBG` so the
  debug block's base is checked too.
