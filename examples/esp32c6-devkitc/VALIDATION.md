# ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 Validation Runbook

Run all commands from `core/`.

## 1) Ensure target installed

```bash
rustup target add riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf
```

The C6 HP core is RV32IMAC on silicon; this L1 smoke links for `riscv32imc`
because the image uses no A-extension instructions and the engine's
interpreter is exercised against that subset. The A extension decodes but is
not part of this image.

## 2) Build smoke firmware

```bash
cargo build -p firmware-esp32c6-demo --release --target riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf
```

Committed copy of the same artifact: `tests/fixtures/esp32c6-demo.elf`.

## 3) Run deterministic UART smoke

```bash
cargo run -q -p labwired-cli -- test \
  --script examples/esp32c6-devkitc/uart-smoke.yaml \
  --output-dir out/esp32c6-devkitc/uart-smoke \
  --no-uart-stdout
```

Pass criteria:

1. exit code is `0`
2. UART contains `OK`

## 4) Run firmware survival gate

```bash
cargo test -p labwired-core --test firmware_survival test_esp32c6_demo_survival -- --nocapture
```

Pass criteria:

1. test passes
2. UART sink contains `OK` (fixture: `tests/fixtures/esp32c6-demo.elf`)

## 5) Run direct simulation for PC/SP evidence

```bash
cargo run -q -p labwired-cli -- \
  --firmware tests/fixtures/esp32c6-demo.elf \
  --system configs/systems/esp32c6-devkitc.yaml \
  --max-steps 200000
```

Pass criteria: the console shows `OK` and the run ends at the step limit with
the PC still inside the C6 flash window (0x4200_0000..0x42FF_FFFF).

## 6) Run unsupported-instruction audit

```bash
./scripts/unsupported_instruction_audit.sh \
  --firmware tests/fixtures/esp32c6-demo.elf \
  --system configs/systems/esp32c6-devkitc.yaml \
  --max-steps 200000 \
  --out-dir out/unsupported-audit/esp32c6
```

Pass criteria:

1. script exits `0`
2. audit report exists at `out/unsupported-audit/esp32c6/report.md`

## 7) Tier-1 fixture (all 12 classes)

```bash
scripts/tier1/build_esp32c6.sh

./target/debug/labwired run \
  --chip configs/chips/esp32c6.yaml \
  --firmware tests/fixtures/tier1/esp32c6.elf \
  --max-steps 8000000 2>&1 | grep -a TIER1
```

Observed (2026-09-21, `feat/c6-irq-wdt-depth`):

```text
TIER1 clock PASS
TIER1 gpio PASS
TIER1 timer PASS
TIER1 dma PASS
TIER1 irq PASS
TIER1 i2c PASS
TIER1 spi PASS
TIER1 adc PASS
TIER1 pwm PASS
TIER1 wdt PASS
TIER1 rtc PASS
TIER1 done
```

What each line proves:

- `clock` — `pcr` is a native register file (full SVD map): `UART0_SCLK_CONF`
  and `SYSCLK_CONF` round-trip documented values; `UART0_CONF.CLK_EN=0` makes
  UART0 reads return 0 and drops writes (the pre-gate value survives), and
  reopening the gate restores it. The same `clock:` gate is declared for
  UART1/TIMG0/TIMG1/GDMA/I²C0/SPI2/LEDC/SARADC. `RST_EN` is recorded, not
  enforced.
- `gpio` — `OUT`/`ENABLE` stores plus the `W1TS`/`W1TC` set/clear aliases read
  back through `OUT`/`ENABLE`; `FUNC4_OUT_SEL_CFG` and `FUNC6_IN_SEL_CFG`
  round-trip; `IN` does not follow the output latch.
- `timer` — TIMG0 (`esp32c6_mwdt` = shared `esp32::timg::Timg` + MWDT):
  `T0CONFIG.EN` set, `T0UPDATE`-latched `T0LO/T0HI` advances across a bounded
  spin; clearing `EN` freezes it.
- `dma` — GDMA (3 channels): real in-RAM linked-list mem→mem transfer;
  descriptors walked, bytes land in the destination, `IN_SUC_EOF`/`IN_DONE`
  and `OUT_TOTAL_EOF`/`OUT_DONE` latch, owners write back.
- `irq` — two real RISC-V traps. Software: `CPU_INTR_FROM_CPU_0` (matrix
  source 22, INTPRI doorbell `@0x600C_5090`) is mapped to line 9, line 9 is
  enabled with a passing priority, and the fixture's `mtvec` entry observes
  `mcause=0x8000_0009` and acknowledges it. A second doorbell with the line
  disabled must not trap (enable-gate proof). Peripheral: UART0's `irq: 43`
  descriptor wiring makes the shared Espressif twin assert matrix source 43,
  mapped to enabled line 10; `INT_ENA.TX_DONE` is armed, one byte is shifted
  through the TX FIFO so the latched `TX_DONE` raw bit rises, and the trap
  carries `mcause=0x8000_000A`. The handler's `UART_INT_CLR` W1C write clears
  the source (it also masks the line, because the model re-derives a
  scheduler-driven level at the peripheral tick); the fixture re-enables line
  10 and requires no second trap, proving the line de-asserted. A register
  round-trip of each MAP word is checked first.
- `i2c` — I²C0 (`esp32c3_i2c` at `0x6000_4000`, source 50): a
  RSTART→WRITE(1)→STOP command list runs to completion — `TRANS_START`
  self-clears, every executed `COMD` slot latches `command_done`, and
  `INT_RAW.TRANS_COMPLETE` latches after the wire transaction. No slave is
  attached: the address byte is NACKed and no read path is claimed.
- `spi` — GP-SPI2 (`esp32c3_spi` at `0x6008_1000`, source 72): launching
  `SPI_CMD.USR` self-clears, `TRANS_DONE` latches in `DMA_INT_RAW`, and `W0`
  reads back `0xFFFF_FFFF` — the idle pulled-high MISO line really shifted
  through the engine.
- `adc` — APB_SARADC (`esp32c3_apb_saradc` at `0x6000_E000`, source 60): a
  one-shot conversion self-clears `ONETIME_START`, latches `SAR1_DONE`, and
  `SAR1DATA_STATUS` carries a channel-dependent 12-bit sample plus the packed
  channel id; channels 3 and 5 differ predictably.
- `pwm` — LEDC (`esp32c3_ledc` at `0x6000_7000`, source 45): TIMER0's live
  counter advances with elapsed cycles, wraps at the programmed `2^DUTY_RES`
  period and latches `LSTIMER0_OVF`; `PAUSE` freezes the counter and stops new
  overflows.
- `wdt` — TIMG0 MWDT (`esp32c6_mwdt` + `with_mwdt`): `WDTWPROTECT` resets to
  the key (unlocked); locking it makes `WDTCONFIG0..5` writes drop while
  `WDTFEED` stays writable; `WDTCONFIG1` round-trips; with `STG0_HOLD`
  programmed the walk-driven stage-0 countdown latches
  `INT_RAW_TIMERS.WDT_INT_RAW` and `INT_CLR_TIMERS` clears it W1C. The
  four-stage chain is real: with `STG1_HOLD`/`STG1=interrupt` also configured,
  a second latch arrives WITHOUT a feed (only the chain advancing into stage 1
  can produce it), and a further feed restarts stage 0 (the model is in stage
  2 by then, whose seeded SVD hold is ~1M walk ticks). The CPU/system reset
  actions (STG=2/3) are NOT performed — no safe bus reset-request path exists.
- `rtc` — LP_TIMER (`esp32c6_lp_rtc` at `0x600B_0C00`): the `UPDATE` bit-28
  strobe latches the live 48-bit counter into `MAIN_BUF0`; the readout stays
  frozen until the next strobe; a second strobe after elapsed cycles is
  strictly greater and shifts the previous snapshot into `MAIN_BUF1`. No
  RTC-slow rate, alarms or sleep retention.
- `uart` — implicit: the transcript arrived over UART0.

All twelve classes the matrix tracks (`clock` `gpio` `uart` `timer` `dma`
`irq` `i2c` `spi` `adc` `pwm` `wdt` `rtc`) pass; none is faked or weakened.
The per-class claim boundaries are mirrored in
[`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

## 8) Unsupported-instruction audit (L2 evidence)

```bash
./scripts/unsupported_instruction_audit.sh \
  --firmware tests/fixtures/tier1/esp32c6.elf \
  --system configs/systems/esp32c6-devkitc.yaml \
  --max-steps 200000 \
  --out-dir out/unsupported-audit/esp32c6-devkitc
```

Observed: `unknown_riscv: 0`, `unsupported_total: 0` (report in
`out/unsupported-audit/esp32c6-devkitc/report.md`).
