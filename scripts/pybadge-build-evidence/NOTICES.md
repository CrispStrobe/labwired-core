# Notice evidence — qualification pending

The qualified origin inventory binds 438 files to pinned Git blobs, 67 to original
request bytes and one to a captured generated header. The 36 toolchain headers
remain explicitly unreviewed. Existing evidence captures four repository licence
files, but no ASF4 root licence; absence is not a licence grant.

This follow-up collects bounded **leading comment candidates**, preserving exact
bytes and stopping before implementation/preprocessor text. A comment may be
descriptive rather than a notice; absence never grants permission. Each record
binds to its dependency SHA256 and the complete origin/report hashes. It also
checks captured component licence files against their pinned Git content, and
captures installed dpkg package ownership/version and copyright files for the
toolchain headers. No header/implementation body is copied outside comments.

Acceptance requires the actual hosted artifact, a separate raw-byte/hash/binding
audit and every enabled exact-head check. Preserve failures for ambiguous package
ownership, missing copyrights, oversized comments or changed source bytes. No
automatic SPDX/permission classification, package-archive provenance, retained
inline attribution, source-to-binary proof, runtime admission or store clearance
is claimed. Review the exact notices and applicable obligations before selecting
permissive replacement slices. This integration reads/hash-checks source bodies;
it is not an isolated implementation or whole-firmware clean-room claim.

No firmware guest/disassembly, app pin, hardware ACK, capture, performance floor
or historical-image classification changes. Build and probes stay hosted; this
collector itself runs only metadata/hash reads and no compiler/linker/guest.
