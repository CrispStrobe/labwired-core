# STM32G0 IO-Link firmware prerequisites

The in-repo examples for USART1, TIM2, and the G0 EXTI bank are
[`examples/stm32g0b1re/`](../examples/stm32g0b1re/README.md). They print
`OK`, program TIM2 `PSC = 15`, and unmask a PB0 falling edge. They are
not the customer image.

The customer STM32G0B1RE/TIOL112 reference ELF boots on the G0 descriptor,
configures its 1 MHz TIM2 timebase, and executes its own EXTI0/1 wake handler.
The tests assert that firmware clears the falling-edge flag and programs
USART1 for COM2. GPIO PA9 uses the G0 AF1 UART output route rather than the
L0 AF4 route; mux, polarity, split pending flags and selective W1C behavior
have separate regressions.

This is a simulator prerequisite. It does not yet exercise an electrical C/Q
link, master exchange, cable loading, supply faults or a physical board.
The descriptor includes only the peripherals used by this reference. Its
GPIO EXTI path excludes software triggers and internal event lines. The
128 KiB parity-protected SRAM region is exposed; additional parity storage
is excluded. The general Cortex-M interpreter does not enforce every M0+
instruction restriction; the actual firmware is compiled for Cortex-M0+.

Build the customer reference as documented in
[iolinki](https://github.com/w1ne/iolinki/tree/5572a628b8befa6a9c74496311da2359868f96d9/examples/stm32g0_tiol112),
then run from this repository:

```sh
export IOLINKI_G0_ELF=/absolute/path/to/reference-device.elf
cargo test -p labwired-core --test g0_uart_pad --test g0_exti --test g0_reference_firmware -- --include-ignored
cargo test -p labwired-core --features event-scheduler --test g0_uart_pad --test g0_exti --test g0_reference_firmware -- --include-ignored
```

The firmware test is explicitly ignored without an external build; the CI
workflow builds the pinned customer sources and requires this test in both
execution modes. Missing firmware is an error in that test. The same workflow
also runs the actual ELF through the user-facing CLI with mandatory EXTI mux,
falling-edge/mask and TIM2 prescaler assertions:

```sh
cargo run -p labwired-cli --bin labwired -- test --script validation/iolinki/g0-startup.yaml --firmware "$IOLINKI_G0_ELF"
```

The CLI witness proves descriptor reachability and firmware startup; the Rust
harness separately proves the external WAKE interrupt. Neither proves UART
byte exchange. The workflow
records the ELF SHA-256 and archives the ELF/map/HEX artifacts.

Local witness on 2026-10-01: ARM GCC 13.2.1 produced ELF SHA-256
`44b97d0d7b2dd6d9e9800626728a2b034b2cd856033e8fbeab25a2d521eb00a7`.
All five focused tests passed in both modes. The ELF wake test executes
500,000 startup instructions and 100,000 after the external edge; its
assertions inspect registers configured or cleared by the actual firmware.
The SHA identifies that local build, not every compiler's future output.

The G0 throughput gate uses the standard `firmware-perf-spin` ALU loop on
`configs/chips/stm32g0b1re.yaml`, separately from the customer ELF witness.
On 2026-10-01, Rust 1.95.0's release CLI with `event-scheduler` measured
854.5 host instructions per simulated instruction in step mode and 1.3 in
batch mode, using Callgrind's instruction-count slope. The batch run retired
the requested instruction count and reported 1023.9 steps per dispatch batch.
Only these two newly measured board-mode baselines were added:

```sh
cargo build --release -p labwired-cli --bin labwired --features event-scheduler
python3 scripts/perf/board_perf.py --boards stm32g0b1re --update --require-all
```

This throughput fixture measures engine overhead; it does not exercise an
electrical IO-Link link or prove customer application throughput.
