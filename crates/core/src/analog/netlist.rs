//! Parser for the SPICE subset the in-core analog engine solves.
//!
//! The subset is deliberately small, because everything in it has to stay
//! deterministic in the browser with no dependencies. Anything outside it
//! (subcircuits, model libraries, AC/DC sweeps, device capacitances) is not
//! approximated and not silently dropped: it is a hard error that names the
//! line and points at the ngspice adapter, which does support it.
//!
//! ## Elements
//!
//! | Element | Line |
//! |---|---|
//! | Resistor | `R<name> n1 n2 <value>` |
//! | Capacitor | `C<name> n1 n2 <value> [ic=<v>]` |
//! | Inductor | `L<name> n1 n2 <value> [ic=<i>]` |
//! | Voltage source | `V<name> n+ n- <source>` |
//! | Current source | `I<name> n+ n- <source>` |
//! | Switch | `S<name> n1 n2 <ctrl> ron=<r> roff=<r>` |
//! | Diode | `D<name> n+ n- <model>` |
//! | BJT | `Q<name> nc nb ne <model>` |
//! | MOSFET | `M<name> nd ng ns nb <model> [w=<m>] [l=<m>]` |
//! | VCVS | `E<name> n+ n- nc+ nc- <gain>` |
//! | VCCS | `G<name> n+ n- nc+ nc- <transconductance>` |
//! | CCCS | `F<name> n+ n- <vsource> <gain>` |
//! | CCVS | `H<name> n+ n- <vsource> <transresistance>` |
//! | Op-amp / comparator | `X<name> in+ in- v+ v- out <model>` |
//!
//! The four dependent sources are SPICE's linear ones and nothing more: `POLY`,
//! `VALUE={...}` and `TABLE` forms are refused by name. `E` and `H` each add a
//! branch current, numbered after every voltage source and inductor; `F` and
//! `H` read the branch current of the element they name, which must be one that
//! carries one (a `V`, `L`, `E` or `H`).
//!
//! `X` is SPICE's subcircuit call, and the in-core engine has no subcircuits.
//! It accepts an `X` line only when its model names an `OPAMP` or `COMP` card
//! (built in, or declared with `.model`); the pin order is the one vendor
//! op-amp and comparator models use (`IN+ IN- VCC VEE OUT`). Any other `X` line
//! is a real subcircuit call and is refused with the pointer to ngspice. The
//! element is lowered, at parse time, into the primitives above; see
//! [`OpAmpModel`] and [`ComparatorModel`] for exactly what it becomes.
//!
//! `<source>` is `[dc] <value>`, `SIN(vo va freq [td [theta]])` or
//! `PULSE(v1 v2 [td [tr [tf [pw [per]]]]])`, spelled as in SPICE. A source that
//! carries a function is driven by the clock, so it cannot also be a routed
//! input — [`super::adapter`] rejects a manifest that wires one.
//!
//! ## Models
//!
//! `.model <name> D|NPN|PNP|NMOS|PMOS (<param>=<value> ...)` declares a model
//! card; parameters may also be written without the parentheses, and a card may
//! be declared after the elements that use it. Parameters this engine does not
//! model (every capacitance, every temperature coefficient, `VAF`, `IKF`,
//! `GAMMA`, …) are **accepted and ignored** rather than rejected, so a vendor
//! model pasted from a datasheet still runs — with the large-signal DC
//! behaviour it describes and none of its charge storage. See
//! [`super::device`] for what that costs.
//!
//! An element may also name one of five built-in cards and skip `.model`
//! entirely: `D` (1N4148-class, `IS=2.52n N=1.752`), `NPN`, `PNP` (β = 100),
//! `NMOS`, `PMOS` (`VTO=±1 V`, `KP=20u`, `LAMBDA=0.02`). Those are *this
//! engine's* convenience values and are not ngspice's parameter defaults; a
//! parameter omitted from a real `.model` line gets ngspice's default, so a
//! deck written out in full means the same thing to both engines.
//!
//! Five more built-in cards name part families, for the same reason: an
//! imported board says `1N4733A` or `LM358`, not a parameter list. They are
//! `1N4733A` (5.1 V zener), `SMAJ5.0A` (5 V TVS), `IDEAL_OPAMP`, `LM358` and
//! `LM393`; [`builtin_model`] gives their values and where each came from.
//! They are *-like* cards — the datasheet's headline numbers, not the vendor's
//! macro model.
//!
//! A diode card may carry `BV` (reverse breakdown voltage), `IBV` (the current
//! at `BV`, default 1 mA) and `NBV` (breakdown emission coefficient, default
//! `N`); with `BV` set the diode is solved with ngspice's three-region level-1
//! equation, and with it unset the diode is exactly what it was before
//! breakdown existed. `.model <name> OPAMP(...)` and `.model <name> COMP(...)`
//! are this engine's own card types, not ngspice's.
//!
//! ## Directives and comments
//!
//! Plus `*` comments, `;`/`$` trailing comments, `.end`, `.ic V(node)=<v>` and
//! `.options`/`.print`/`.tran`/`.save`/`.control`…`.endc`, which are accepted
//! and ignored so that one deck can be handed to both this engine and ngspice.
//!
//! Note on the first line: a classic SPICE deck treats line 1 as a title and
//! ignores it. This parser does not, because silently dropping an element line
//! is the worst failure mode a netlist parser has. Put a `*` on your comment.
