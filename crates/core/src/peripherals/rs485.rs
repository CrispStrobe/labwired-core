//! **RS-485 transceiver gate** — what a MAX485 does between a UART and a
//! shared A/B pair.
//!
//! The transceiver has two halves. The driver puts DI on the bus while DE is
//! high. The receiver puts the bus on RO while /RE is low. Both can be on at
//! once, which is how a master hears its own frame (half-duplex echo). The
//! gate lives inside the [`Uart`](super::uart::Uart) that DI and RO are wired
//! to, because that UART is where the bus's other members already attach: every
//! slave on the pair is one more stream device on that UART, so a multi-drop
//! segment needs no new wiring concept.
//!
//! What the gate decides, byte by byte:
//!
//! * A byte the MCU transmits reaches the bus only while DE is high. With DE
//!   low it still leaves the MCU's TX pin (the console sink sees it), but no
//!   slave hears it.
//! * With DE high and /RE low the MCU receives its own byte back.
//! * A byte a slave puts on the bus reaches the MCU only while /RE is low.
//! * A slave byte while DE is high is a collision with the master's driver, and
//!   so is a byte from two slaves in the same service interval. Both are
//!   reported as contention and neither byte is delivered: two drivers fight on
//!   a real pair and the result is not a valid character.
//!
//! The DE and /RE levels come from level cells the GPIO model keeps equal to
//! the pad (`Peripheral::watch_pad_level`), so the level is the one at the
//! moment of the UART access, not the one at the last scheduler wake-up. That
//! matters here: the model's TX is instantaneous, so firmware drops DE right
//! after `flush()`, and a late sample would see every frame as already over.
//!
//! What the gate does not model: line-level analog behaviour (termination,
//! reflections, biasing), driver slew, a receiver that is enabled during the
//! middle of a character, and the bus turn-around time of the transceiver
//! (a few hundred ns, far below one character).
