//! ESP32-classic Timer Group (TIMG0 / TIMG1) peripheral.
//!
//! Reference: ESP32 TRM v5.0 §16 (Timer Group). Each timer group exposes
//! two 64-bit general-purpose timers (T0/T1) and one Main System Watchdog
//! Timer (MWDT), all sharing one ~0xA4-byte register window.
//!
//! This model is **functional, not cycle-accurate**. Its job is to keep
//! ESP-IDF init code happy:
//!   * Register reads/writes are acknowledged at the correct offsets so
//!     state probes don't fault.
//!   * The 64-bit T0/T1 counters tick monotonically at a deterministic
//!     1 µs cadence (1 increment per `tick()`, assuming 240 MHz CPU and
//!     240 cycles per µs upstream — the bus drives `tick()` once per
//!     simulated µs, see `Bus::tick_peripherals_with_costs`).
//!   * `T0_UPDATE` / `T1_UPDATE` latches the live counter into LO/HI so
//!     subsequent register reads return a consistent 64-bit snapshot —
//!     real silicon also requires this strobe before reading LO/HI.
//!   * Watchdog feeds (any write to the classic `WDT_FEED_REG`) are silently
//!     accepted; we don't model WDT-induced resets. The C3/C6 MWDT layout can
//!     opt into the real four-stage chain with [`Timg::with_mwdt`] (write
//!     lock, SVD config/hold resets, stage holds, per-stage actions, feed,
//!     INT latch) — see its docs for the exact boundary of what is and is not
//!     claimed.
//!   * `RTCCALICFG.START` (bit 31) latches `RDY` (bit 15) immediately,
//!     preserving the calibration-loop unblock semantics from the
//!     pre-existing `TimgStub`. Without it, esp-idf's
//!     `rtc_clk_wait_for_slow_cycle` spins forever.
//!   * INT_ENA / INT_RAW / INT_ST / INT_CLR plumbing is byte-addressable
//!     and round-trips — firmware can configure timer interrupt masks
//!     even though we don't actually fire IRQs from this peripheral yet
//!     (deferred to the interrupt-routing follow-up).

    ///
    /// * **Write protection.** WDTWPROTECT (@0x64) resets to [`WDT_WKEY_VALUE`]
    ///   (unlocked, matching silicon). While it holds any other value, writes to
    ///   WDTCONFIG0..5 (@0x48..0x5C, the six-register C3/C6 layout) are dropped.
    ///   WDTFEED and WDTWPROTECT themselves stay writable while locked, as on
    ///   silicon (IDF feeds the watchdog without unlocking it).
    /// * **SVD reset values.** WDTCONFIG0..5 are seeded with their esp32c6.svd
    ///   resets (see [`MWDT_RESETS`]), so the unconfigured stages hold silicon's
    ///   long defaults instead of zero.
    /// * **WDTCONFIG0/1 (and 2..5) round-trip** while unlocked, including the
    ///   enable bit and every stage field.
    /// * **The full four-stage chain.** On the WDTCONFIG0 0→1 EN edge the model
    ///   loads stage 0's hold from WDTCONFIG2 (STG0_HOLD) and counts it down in
    ///   model ticks. When a stage expires the configured action is taken (see
    ///   below), the counter reloads the NEXT stage's hold (STG1_HOLD @0x54,
    ///   STG2_HOLD @0x58, STG3_HOLD @0x5C) and the active stage advances
    ///   `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0`, looping as silicon does (TRM: "the watchdog
    ///   timers will progress through each stage in a loop"). A write to WDTFEED
    ///   (@0x60) reloads stage 0 — "if a watchdog timer is fed by software, the
    ///   timer will return to stage 0" — including while the block is
    ///   write-protected.
    /// * **Stage actions.** WDTCONFIG0's STG0..3 fields encode 0 = off,
    ///   1 = interrupt, 2 = reset CPU, 3 = reset system. For EVERY stage whose
    ///   action is interrupt, its expiry sets INT_RAW_TIMERS.WDT_INT_RAW
    ///   (bit 1); INT_CLR_TIMERS is W1C and is the only thing that clears the
    ///   latch. Off stages consume their hold and advance the chain without an
    ///   action. The reset actions advance the chain and latch nothing — see
    ///   the exclusion below.
    /// * **A walk-driven clock.** Unlike the scheduler-driven GP timers, an
    ///   MWDT must expire with simulated time even when firmware only READS its
    ///   status (a poll loop issues no MMIO writes, and the scheduler path only
    ///   syncs on writes). So `uses_scheduler()` is false while `mwdt` is set:
    ///   the legacy per-tick walk drives the countdown and `sync_to` is a no-op.
    ///   One model tick is one peripheral tick interval (512 cycles under the
    ///   default CLI config); the hold count is therefore in WALK TICKS, not at
    ///   the silicon 12.5 ns × prescaler rate. WDTCONFIG1's prescaler field is
    ///   stored but does not scale the countdown, and a zero hold consumes one
    ///   walk tick per stage transition so the chain always makes progress.
    ///
    /// What this deliberately does NOT claim (and a fixture must not check):
    /// the CPU / system reset actions (STG = 2/3 advances the chain but no
