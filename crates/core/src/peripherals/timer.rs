/// STM32 timer peripheral covering basic, general-purpose, and advanced-
/// control variants:
///
/// - **Basic** (TIM6/TIM7): CR1/DIER/SR/EGR/CNT/PSC/ARR only.
/// - **General-purpose** (TIM2/3/4/5): adds CR2/SMCR/CCMR1/2/CCER + 4
///   capture/compare channels (CCR1..CCR4). TIM2/TIM5 are 32-bit (set
///   `width: 32` in YAML); TIM3/TIM4 are 16-bit.
/// - **Advanced-control** (TIM1/TIM8): general-purpose plus RCR
///   (repetition counter), BDTR (break + dead-time + MOE master output
///   enable), CCMR3, CCR5/CCR6, OR1/OR2. Set `advanced: true` in YAML.
///   The MOE bit in BDTR gates all output channels — without it asserted,
///   PWM outputs stay in their idle state regardless of CCER configuration.
///
/// Counter / ARR width (16 or 32) is selectable via `width: 32` in the
/// chip yaml's `config` block.
///
/// ## Drive modes (walk-free plan Part 2, batches B2/B3)
///
/// Two mutually exclusive time sources, selected by ONE predicate
/// (`scheduler_mode`), following the SysTick (B1) exemplar:
///
/// * **Scheduler mode** (`event-scheduler` feature + a [`CycleClock`] attached
///   at bus registration): `uses_scheduler()` is true, the per-cycle walk skips
///   this peripheral entirely, and
///   - `CNT` / `SR` are **derived lazily** from the bus-published cycle clock
///     with exact closed-form replay of the walk (`advance_to`) — a `&self`
///     read advances `Cell`-held state to "now", so firmware polling `CNT` or
///     `SR` flags observes fresh time without any walk;
///   - update events (UIF) and compare matches (CC1..4IF) that the walk would
///     raise as NVIC interrupts are delivered by **scheduled events**: arming
///     writes hand the bus a `(delay, token)` via `take_scheduled_events`
///     computed in closed form from PSC/ARR/CNT/CCRx/DIER, and `on_event`
///     claims the fire and perpetuates the chain (delay-1 while the legacy
///     walk would hold the IRQ level) — `EventResult::raise_own_irq` pends the
///     peripheral's configured NVIC line through the exact same
///     `pend_irq_for_event` choke the legacy `tick()` path uses.
///
/// * **Legacy mode** (feature off, or no clock attached — hand-built test
///   buses that bypass the bus registration chokes): the per-cycle walk drives
///   `tick()` and the counter advances eagerly, byte-identical to the
///   historical model.
///
/// ### Timing contract
///
/// At tick interval 1 on the batched `Machine::run` path, IRQ pend cycles,
/// `CNT`/`SR` reads, `total_cycles` and register state are **byte-identical**
/// to the walk-driven reference (see
/// `crates/core/tests/stm32_timer_walk_differential.rs` and the in-module
/// `scheduler_matches_walk_*` property gates). At interval N > 1 IRQ pends and
/// lazy reads are quantised to the batch grid — at most one interval
/// late/stale, the same documented bound the write-path `sync_to` ships (and
/// strictly better than the legacy walk at interval N, which under the default
/// `tick_elapsed` slows the count by a factor of N).
///
/// ### Preserved semantics (differentially pinned — including the model's
/// known limitations, kept deliberately so the two drive modes are identical)
///
/// - **IRQ-level counter freeze**: while any enabled status flag is latched
///   (`SR & DIER & 0x1F != 0`) the legacy `tick()` returns the held IRQ level
///   *before* counting, so the counter does not advance until firmware clears
///   the flag. The lazy replay freezes at exactly the same tick.
/// - **Update-tick IRQ vs compare-latch IRQ timing**: an overflow with UIE
///   pends on the overflow tick itself; a compare match latches CCxIF on the
///   match tick and (via the level check) first pends on the **next** tick.
/// - **PSC is applied immediately** (the model has no prescaler buffer;
///   silicon buffers PSC until the next update event). `psc_cnt` keeps its
///   phase across a PSC rewrite, including `psc_cnt > PSC` (next tick
///   increments).
/// - **ARR/CCRx are applied immediately** (no ARPE preload modeling); CR1
///   bits other than CEN (DIR/CMS/OPM/…) are stored but do not affect
///   counting — the model always up-counts, exactly like the walk.
/// - **32-bit `ARR == 0xFFFF_FFFF` never wraps**: the walk's `cnt > arr`
///   check can never fire (u32 wrapping_add), so the counter free-runs
///   mod 2^32 with no UIF — reproduced exactly.
/// - **SMCR (external clock / encoder modes) is a pure register bank bit**:
///   the walk ignores it and always counts the CPU clock, so scheduler mode
///   is exactly as expressive — no configuration needs to stay on the walk.
///
/// ### Tick-cost normalization (B2/B3)
///
/// The legacy model charged `cycles: 1` into the peripheral tick-cost channel
/// on every overflow tick and on every held-IRQ-level tick, inflating
/// `total_cycles` — a sim artifact (real TIMx consumes zero core cycles) that
/// is structurally incompatible with deleting the walk. Both modes now charge
/// zero cost, so the walk-on reference and the scheduler path agree
/// cycle-for-cycle (the same normalization B1 applied to SysTick).
