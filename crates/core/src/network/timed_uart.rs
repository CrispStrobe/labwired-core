//! A timed UART network: serial links between world nodes that take the time
//! the wire takes.
//!
//! The older cross-link medium ([`super::VirtualWireBus`]) hands a byte to the
//! peer the instant firmware writes it, into a queue with no bound. That is
//! enough to prove two firmwares speak the same protocol, and useless for the
//! question a network team asks: *how long does a message take across N hops,
//! and what happens to the buffers when a link slows down or a node restarts?*
//!
//! Here every character is a waveform with a start time:
//!
//! * The sender's USART shifts it out at the baud rate its `BRR` programs, in
//!   the frame format its `CR1`/`CR2` program (data bits, parity, stop bits).
//!   Characters from one sender never overlap: the next start bit follows the
//!   last stop bit.
//! * The link adds a configurable propagation delay and an optional jitter,
//!   drawn from a per-link generator seeded from the manifest, so a run is
//!   reproducible bit for bit.
//! * The receiving USART samples the waveform at ITS OWN baud rate and format,
//!   in the middle of each of its bit cells. Two ends that disagree on the
//!   baud rate therefore read garbage and see framing errors (FE) — the
//!   character is not delivered by magic.
//! * The receiver holds one character (the data register). A character that
//!   completes while the previous one is still unread is lost and sets the
//!   overrun flag (ORE). There is no host-side receive queue.
//!
//! What lives here is only the medium: characters on the wire, per-link
//! statistics and one timeline. The USART register behaviour (TXE/TC/RXNE/ORE,
//! interrupts) is in `peripherals::uart`, in its timed mode.
//!
//! Time is kept in picoseconds of world time: a 115200-baud bit is
//! 8 680 555 ps, and at 84 MHz one CPU cycle is 11 904 ps, so integer ps keep
//! both exact enough that golden numbers can be compared to the cycle.
