//! A reusable oracle for peripheral scheduler migrations.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! Moving a peripheral off the per-cycle legacy walk and onto the event
//! scheduler is the single highest-value optimisation available in this tree,
//! because `SystemBus::max_safe_tick_interval` returns 1 while ANY peripheral
//! answers `needs_legacy_walk() == true`, and at a one-instruction window the
//! Cortex-M hot-loop fast path never engages (it needs a budget of >= 8).
//! Measured on run 35559786580 — same perf fixture, same ISA, same memory map:
//!
//! ```text
//! nrf52840     54.7 Ir/step   interval 512
//! nrf54l15   2119.5 Ir/step   interval   1    38.7x
//! atsamd21   2567.5 Ir/step   interval   1    ~47x
//! ```
//!
//! It is also the easiest change in this tree to get silently wrong. The
//! migration swaps WHEN a peripheral does its work, and a model's own unit
//! tests almost never notice: they construct the model directly, never attach
//! a [`CycleClock`], and therefore keep exercising the LEGACY path after the
//! migration lands. `nrf54l/clock.rs` had thirteen such tests and not one of
//! them could have witnessed a regression in the path that replaced it.
//!
//! # Why a harness rather than another copy
//!
//! Eleven `*_walk_differential` tests already exist, totalling 6207 lines, and
//! each hand-rolls the same four pieces: a `Probe` struct, a `probe()` that
//! snapshots it, a `run_probed()` that single-steps and collects, and an
//! `assert_probes_identical()`. Copying that again for each of the nine
//! peripherals still pinning nrf54l15 / nrf54lm20a / atsamd21g18a is how a
//! migration ends up with no gate at all — the cost of writing one is what
//! makes skipping it tempting.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! Build the SAME machine twice. In [`WalkMode::LegacyWalk`] the peripheral
//! under test is pinned onto the walk with `force_legacy_walk()` — that run is
//! the REFERENCE, and it is the behaviour that shipped. In
//! [`WalkMode::Scheduler`] it is left to the scheduler. Run identical firmware
//! in both and compare every observable at every instruction boundary.
//!
//! What "identical" covers is deliberately wide: `total_cycles`, `pc` and all
//! sixteen core registers come for free, and the caller adds whatever the
//! peripheral's own product is — RAM counters an ISR increments, a DMA
//! destination, captured UART bytes. A migration that changes only timing
//! nobody observes is fine; one that changes a byte or a cycle is not.
//!
//! ## What it does NOT prove
//!
//! * That the scheduler path is REACHED. A model whose `uses_scheduler()`
//!   wrongly returns false passes trivially — both runs are the walk. Assert
//!   the mode separately; [`assert_modes_differ`] is provided for that.
//! * Anything at a tick interval you did not run. IRQ delivery quantises to
//!   the batch grid at interval > 1 (documented, bounded by one interval), so
//!   a byte-identical claim belongs at interval 1, and coarser intervals want
//!   a count-based assertion instead.
