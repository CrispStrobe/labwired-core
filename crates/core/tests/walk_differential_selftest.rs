//! The walk-differential harness, tested on itself.
//!
//! A differential oracle that cannot SEE a divergence is worse than no oracle:
//! it converts "nobody checked" into "the gate is green", which is exactly the
//! failure the harness exists to prevent. So before any migration leans on it,
//! prove each half:
//!
//! * it passes when the two runs really are identical,
//! * it FAILS when they differ — separately for architectural state and for
//!   the caller-supplied observables, because those travel different code
//!   paths through the comparison,
//! * and `assert_modes_differ` catches both directions of the vacuous pass.
//!
//! The last one is the important one. `assert_walk_differential` compares
//! whatever it is handed; if a migration is not in effect it compares the walk
//! against itself and reports success. That is a gate that ran and told you
//! nothing, and it is how eleven hand-rolled copies of this could each have
//! been quietly vacuous without anyone noticing.
