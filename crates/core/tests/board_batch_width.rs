//! Every walk-deleted board must actually batch.
//!
//! A board can be fully scheduler-driven — `walk_deleted`, `max_safe_tick_
//! interval() == 512`, `requires_cycle_accurate() == false` — and still execute
//! one instruction per batch, because any single scheduler event that re-arms
//! one cycle ahead forever pins `plan_cpu_window`'s deadline clamp to 1. Nothing
//! is incorrect when that happens; the board is simply ~500x slower than its
//! siblings, and no functional test can see it.
//!
//! That is exactly how #835 happened. NUCLEO-L073RZ ran at 1.00 steps/batch
//! while L476 and F401 ran at ~511 after #830, and finding out why took a whole
//! investigation of elimination that still ended on a wrong guess (UART). The
//! real cause was I²C: the demo board has no I²C device, so every probe NACKs,
//! the HAL clears CR1.PE to reset the block, and the model leaked BUSY through
//! the disable — leaving `L4I2c::active()` true, and its per-cycle engine chain
//! re-arming at +1 for the rest of the run.
//!
//! So batch width is asserted directly, per board. This is a THROUGHPUT gate
//! (`scripts/perf/board_perf.py` measures host cost per step; this measures how
//! many steps the engine is willing to run per plan), and it fails loudly on the
//! board that regressed rather than on a repo-wide average.

// The boards that are actually slow.
//
// The three tests above are STM32, and they were added because #835 needed
// them. Meanwhile the perf fleet's batch column — the DEFAULT path — is
// bimodal, and none of the slow side is measured here:
//
//     ARM / nRF / STM32 / RP   ~54 Ir/step   width  511.9
//     esp32c3  (RISC-V)        201.8         width  511.9
//     atmega328p (AVR)         241.3         width   25.0   <-- 20x narrow
//     esp32s3  (Xtensa)        364.8         width 1023.9   <-- WIDEST, still 6.7x
//     esp32    (Xtensa)        442.4         width  511.9
//
// Those two shapes are different defects and the width separates them.
// `atmega328p` is bound by something: at 25 instructions per batch the
// per-batch overhead is amortised over twenty times fewer instructions than
// anywhere else. `esp32s3` has the widest batch of any board in the fleet and
// still costs 6.7x ARM, which rules per-batch overhead OUT and puts the cost
// inside the instruction loop.
//
// `quantum_trace` exists to answer the first question — the module says #835
// "ruled out three clauses, and still ended on a guess" before it did — but it
// has never been pointed at the narrow board. That is what this section is
// for: measure the width here, and under `--features quantum-trace` print the
// clause that bound it, so the next step is a name instead of a guess.
