//! BMP280: the declarative descriptor against the hand-written model it
//! replaces.
//!
//! `components/bmp280.rs` survives as the byte-parity ORACLE (see the note
//! below for why it is not deleted), and both models are driven through the
//! SAME I²C script. Transcripts that must be identical are asserted equal byte
//! for byte; the one that must differ is asserted as a difference, by name.
//!
//! ⚠️ **This part answers CONSTANTS.** `ADC_T` and `ADC_P` were the literal
//! `0x80000` in the model and are the literal `0x800000` reset word of two
//! three-byte registers in the descriptor; neither model declares a stimulus
//! channel. That is the port, and `configs/devices/bmp280.yaml` states in its
//! own header what driving the part would take — an inverse of Bosch's
//! compensation, which is quadratic in `adc_T` and therefore needs a square
//! root the `derived:` grammar does not have.
//!
//! Held identical:
//!   * the whole 26-byte calibration read (0x88..0xA1), including the two
//!     reserved bytes that read 0x00 where an undeclared address reads 0xFF —
//!     compared against the exact `CALIB` array the deleted model carried;
//!   * CHIP_ID = 0x58;
//!   * STATUS / CTRL_MEAS / CONFIG, their read-back, and the 0xB6 soft reset
//!     clearing all three (and NO other value doing so);
//!   * the six data bytes at 0xF7..0xFC, and the 20-bit words a driver
//!     reassembles from them;
//!   * every unmodelled address reading 0xFF, and the pointer wrapping
//!     0xFF → 0x00;
//!   * writes to the calibration block, the chip id and the data registers
//!     being dropped.
//!
//! Deliberately DIFFERENT (its own test below):
//!   * the RESET register (0xE0) still reads 0xFF after a write, on BOTH
//!     models — but for different reasons, and the descriptor says so out
//!     loud through `write_mask: 0x00` instead of by having no read arm. The
//!     observable difference is what a write of a NON-reset value does to the
//!     three writable registers: nothing, on both. Asserted so the `when:`
//!     guard is proved rather than assumed.
//!
//! Scripts are driven through the shared harness (`tests/common/transcript.rs`),
//! the same one the byte-parity ratchet uses.

// slave and any one will do, and `crates/core/src/peripherals/esp32c3/` is
// covered by a silicon drift-ack digest (`validation/manifest.yaml`) that an
// edit to a test module inside it would invalidate — a red `--check --drift`
// gate for a change that touches no model. The struct is excluded from the
// declarative-coverage ratchet with that reason, exactly as `veml7700.rs` and
// `pca9685.rs` are.
//
// Reading the real module rather than a copy is strictly better here: the two
// cannot drift apart, and a change to the oracle that the descriptor does not
// match fails below rather than silently becoming the new truth.
