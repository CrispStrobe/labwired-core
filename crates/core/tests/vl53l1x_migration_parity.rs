//! VL53L1X: the declarative descriptor against the hand-written model it
//! replaces.
//!
//! The deleted `components/vl53l1x.rs` is reproduced below as [`legacy`] — the
//! wire behaviour only — and both models are driven through the SAME I²C
//! script. Transcripts that must be identical are asserted equal byte for
//! byte; the one that must differ is asserted as a difference, by name.
//!
//! Held identical:
//!   * the 16-bit register pointer: two address bytes high-first, latched
//!     across the repeated START, wrapping at 0xFFFF;
//!   * `IDENTIFICATION__MODEL_ID` = 0xEACC, read as the 16-bit word the Pololu
//!     `init()` compares and as its two bytes separately;
//!   * the `GPIO__TIO_HV_STATUS` data-ready line: odd before ranging, even
//!     after `startContinuous()`, odd again after `stopContinuous()`;
//!   * the whole 17-byte `readResults()` burst, including the zero bytes
//!     between the three that matter, at every integer millimetre of the
//!     declared 0..4000 channel range (`raw_range_matches_at_every_millimetre`);
//!   * `init()`'s 8-byte block write at 0x002D, which walks straight over
//!     `GPIO__TIO_HV_STATUS` and must NOT disturb it;
//!   * an undeclared address answering 0x00 rather than open bus.
//!
//! Deliberately DIFFERENT (each with its own test below):
//!   * where the millimetre channel is ROUNDED. The hand model rounded the
//!     question (`set_input` stored `value.round() as u16`); the descriptor
//!     rounds the answer (the encode's `round: nearest`). They agree on every
//!     integer millimetre and can differ by one raw count on a fractional one.
//!   * `SYSTEM__MODE_START` READS BACK. It is a read/write register on silicon
//!     (ST UM2356 §2.3); the hand model had no read arm for it, so it accepted
//!     the write and then answered 0x00 for ever. The Pololu driver never
//!     reads the address, so nothing depends on either answer.
//!
//! Scripts are driven through the shared harness (`tests/common/transcript.rs`),
//! the same one the byte-parity ratchet uses.
