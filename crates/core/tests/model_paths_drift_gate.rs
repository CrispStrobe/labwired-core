//! Every model a board actually registers must appear in its `models:` list.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! `validation/manifest.yaml` records a `models:` path list per board, and
//! `scripts/generate_validation_status.py` hashes exactly those files into the
//! board's drift digest. A model the list omits is INVISIBLE to the drift
//! gate: the file can be rewritten and the board still reads as fresh, so a
//! stale `drift_ack` keeps covering a tree it was never written for.
//!
//! Not hypothetical, and not a one-off. The manifest already names one
//! instance in its own header ("the esp32c3 hole"). A second was found the
//! same way this gate would have: `nrf54l15` listed only `cpu/cortex_m.rs`,
//! `decoder/arm.rs` and its chip YAML — not `peripherals/nrf54l/{clock,uarte,
//! twim}.rs`, the models its own `note:` advertises. The walk-deletion work
//! rewrote all three and the digest did not move, while `atsamd21g18a`'s did,
//! because that board happens to list `sam/sercom_usart.rs`.
//!
//! # Why it asks the engine
//!
//! A chip YAML names its models two ways:
//!
//! ```text
//! path:  "../peripherals/<chip>/<block>.yaml"   a declarative register bank
//! type:  "nrf54l_uarte"                         a Rust model, via a factory
//! ```
//!
//! The first version of this gate mined `type:` -> source from the factory
//! match arms with a regex. It resolved 4 types out of 67 while reporting
//! itself complete: the arms come in too many shapes (qualified paths,
//! imported names, braced blocks, `a | b =>` alternations, one factory per
//! family). A gate that silently drops what it cannot parse is green exactly
//! where it is blind, which is worse than no gate.
//!
//! So this builds each board's bus through the SAME `SystemBus::from_config`
//! the product uses, and asks every registered peripheral what it is via
//! [`Peripheral::impl_type_path`]. There is no second implementation of the
//! dispatch chain to drift out of step with the first.
